- **Input Validation**: Comprehensive error handling and input validation
- **Flexible Tenure Options**: Pre-defined tenure options (5-35 years) with custom input support
- **Real-time Calculations**: Instant results with detailed breakdowns

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

Make sure you have Python 3.7+ installed on your system.

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/junyi121212121212/SIP_Calculator.git
   cd SIP_Calculator
   ```

2. **Install required dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install customtkinter matplotlib numpy
   ```

3. **Run the application**:

   ./SIP_calculator.exe  # Windows
   ```

## üìä How to Use

### SIP Calculator
1. Enter your **monthly SIP amount** (e.g., 5000)
2. Select **investment tenure** from dropdown (5-35 years)
3. Input **expected rate of return** (e.g., 12 for 12% annual return)
4. Click **Calculate** to see results

### Lump Sum Calculator

### Key Calculations

**SIP Formula**:
```
M = P √ó [((1 + i)^n - 1) / i] √ó (1 + i)
```
Where:
- M = Maturity Amount
- P = Monthly Investment
- i = Monthly Interest Rate (Annual Rate / 12)
- n = Total number of months

**Lump Sum Formula**:
```
M = P √ó (1 + r)^t
```
Where:
- M = Maturity Amount
- P = Principal Amount
- r = Annual Interest Rate
- t = Time in years

## üéØ Features in Detail

### Input Validation
- Prevents fractional values for amounts and tenure
- Validates numerical inputs only
- Ensures ROI doesn't exceed 100%
- Prevents zero values for critical fields
- Mutual exclusivity between SIP and Lump Sum modes

### Visualization Components
- **Pie Chart**: Shows proportion of invested capital vs returns
- **Growth Chart**: Displays portfolio growth trajectory over time
- **Color Coding**: Green theme for positive growth visualization

### User Interface
- **Clean Design**: Modern green-accented interface
- **Responsive Layout**: Organized input and output sections
- **Error Handling**: User-friendly error messages
- **Reset Functionality**: Easy form clearing

## üîß Development

### Creating Executable
